<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dry Cooling Tower Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Cooling Tower</li><li>Closed Cooling Tower</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dry cooling tower market consists of two main types: open and closed cooling towers. Open cooling towers allow air to flow freely, utilizing evaporation to dissipate heat, making them suitable for large industrial applications. In contrast, closed cooling towers prevent air contact with the coolant, using a heat exchanger to reject heat, which enhances efficiency and is ideal for environments sensitive to contamination. Both types play vital roles in energy efficiency and environmental sustainability across various industries.</p></p>
