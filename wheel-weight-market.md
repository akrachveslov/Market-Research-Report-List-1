<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wheel Weight Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Clip-On Type</li><li>Adhesive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wheel weight market consists primarily of two types: clip-on and adhesive weights. Clip-on weights are designed to attach to the rim's edge, providing a secure fit and easy installation. They are commonly used in conventional tire balancing. Adhesive weights, on the other hand, stick directly to the wheel's inner surface, offering a more discreet appearance and often used in alloy wheels. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring optimal wheel balance and vehicle performance.</p></p>
