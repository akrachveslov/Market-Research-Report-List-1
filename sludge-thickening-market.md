<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sludge Thickening Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity Thickening</li><li>Dissolved Air Flotation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sludge thickening market features technologies like gravity thickening and dissolved air flotation (DAF). Gravity thickening relies on sedimentation, allowing solid particles to settle at the bottom, enhancing sludge concentration through gravitational forces. In contrast, DAF utilizes air bubbles to agitate sludge, promoting solid separation and rising to the surface for easy removal. Both methods effectively increase sludge density, improving wastewater treatment efficiency and reducing operational costs in various industrial and municipal applications.</p></p>
