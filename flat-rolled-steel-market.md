<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flat Rolled Steel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Hot Rolled"</li><li>"Cold Rolled"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The flat rolled steel market is primarily divided into hot rolled and cold rolled segments. Hot rolled steel is produced by rolling steel at high temperatures, resulting in a thicker, less precise product generally used in construction and manufacturing due to its malleability. In contrast, cold rolled steel undergoes further processing at room temperature, yielding a smoother surface and tighter tolerances, making it ideal for applications requiring precision, such as automotive and appliances. Both types cater to varied industrial needs.</p></p>
